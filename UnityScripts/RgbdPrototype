/* Here's the problem, in order to not move along the Y axis when moving around the map (the Y axis should only be
accessed by the scrollwheel) the only usable command that I found for a rigidbody was FreezePosition. So, I made it to
where all the movement IF statements contained the FreezePosition.Y command and it *almost* works. The problem is
usually you will want to scroll down at the same time you are moving, but when you scroll the script sees that you
are also moving and FreezePosition.Y is in effect. So you can only scroll down if you are not moving. To fix this
I made a few statements as seen below that say in laymans terms "only freeze axis Y if I am not scrolling" and only 
freeze X and Z if I am not moving. While in theory this should have more or less worked, it has some definite bugs. 
See if you can come up with a more elegant solution. */
